"""
Unit Test â€” Gold Layer Creation

This script validates the correct generation of the Gold Layer in the
Medallion architecture pipeline.

It performs the following checks:
1. Ensures that the Gold Layer Parquet file is successfully created.
2. Confirms that the resulting DataFrame is not empty.
3. Verifies that the expected columns exist in the aggregated dataset.

This test helps guarantee the integrity of the aggregation process 
from the Silver Layer to the Gold Layer.

    Unit test to validate the Gold Layer creation and structure.
    
    Steps:
    1. Execute the `silver_to_gold()` transformation function.
    2. Check whether the output Parquet file exists at the expected location.
    3. Load the Parquet file into a DataFrame.
